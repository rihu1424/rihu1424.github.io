    <h1>HTML Midterm</h1>

    <h2>Page 1</h2> 
    <ul>  
        <li>Added a meta to the document.</li>
        <li>On line 39, the h2 tag was inside of an unclosed table element.
            Closed the table element so h2 appears outside of it.</li>
        <li>Added a lang attribute to the html start tag to declare a language for
            the document.</li>
        <li>Added a break between the image and the example link to help with the structure of the page.</li> 
    </ul>
    <hr>

    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Closed the bold tag surrounding "New Beehive Inn". </li>
        <li>On line 51 moved the b element inside of h2 since h2 cannot be nested within b.</li>
        <li>On line 55, replaced "where do i go" with a link to a wiki about segmental arches.</li>
        <li>Replaced the broken link on line 39 with a working link. The link now goes to wikipedia about bays. </li> 
        <li>Put "history" inside of an h2 element instead of h6. Also closed the element so hr wasn't inside of it.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
