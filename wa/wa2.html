        <p>My goal for this course is to learn the skills necessary to code my own portfolio website. 
            I am currently enrolled in Media Design Portfolio 1, and would love to be able to  
            showcase my work on a webpage that I created from the ground up. While there are resources such as 
            Adobe Portfolio, Squarespace, etc. I would take some pride in knowing that my website is 
            a huge portfolio piece by itself.</p>
        <p>A little bit about myself: I am originally from Eugene, Oregon, but a lot of my family is from Denver. I plan to graduate this spring, 
            but I have no post graduation plans (yikes). Outside of school I enjoy video games, art, design,
            and I am a huge fan of live music, especially Tipper & Friends. I also like to DJ at local venues from time to time, but this is just 
            a hobby and not something I take super seriously at the moment.</p>
