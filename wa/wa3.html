    <p><strong>Ramen </strong> is a Japanese noodle dish. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles (or 中華麺, chūkamen) served in a broth; common 
       flavors are soy sauce and miso, with typical toppings including sliced pork (chāshū), nori (dried seaweed), 
       menma (bamboo shoots), and scallions. Ramen has its roots in Chinese noodle dishes. Nearly every region 
       in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the tonkotsu (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu and the miso 
       ramen of Hokkaido.</p>
    <p>The origin of ramen is traced back to Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. 
        The word "ramen" is a Japanese borrowing of the Chinese word 拉麵 (lāmiàn), meaning 'pulled noodles'. 
        The dish evolved from southern Chinese noodle dishes, reflecting the demographics of Chinese settlers in Yokohama. 
        Ramen gained popularity in Japan, especially during food shortages following World War II. 
        In 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, further popularizing the dish. 
        Today, ramen is a cultural icon in Japan, with many regional varieties and a wide range of toppings.</p>

        <h3 id="Etymology">Etymology</h3>
            <p>The word ramen is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese lāmiàn (拉麵, 'pulled noodles'). 
                However, historian Barak Kushner argues that this borrowing occurred retroactively and that various independent Japanese 
                corruptions of Chinese words had already led to Japanese people calling this Chinese noodle dish "ramen".
                One theory suggests that the Japanese mistook the Chinese particles le (了) or la (啦, a contraction of 了啊)for a "ra" sound when 
                Chinese cooks would announce hăo le (好了) to communicate that a dish was complete. The Japanese then appended the word men (麵, meaning 'noodle') 
                to the "ra" to create the word ramen. Early ramen or ramen-like dishes went by different names, such as Nankin soba 
                (南京そば, literally 'Nanjing soba', named after the city which was the then capital of China), Shina soba (支那そば, literally 'Chinese soba'), 
                or Chūka soba (中華そば, also meaning 'Chinese soba'). Until the 1950s, ramen was most commonly called Shina soba, 
                but today Chūka soba or just ramen (ラーメン) are more common, as the word 支那 (Shina, meaning 'China') has acquired a pejorative 
                connotation through its association with Japanese imperialism.</p>
        <h3 id="Origin">Origin</h3>
            <p>Ramen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodle soups. It is first recorded to have appeared in Yokohama Chinatown in the early 20th century. 
                Although the ramen takes its name from lāmiàn, it does not actually evolve from the northern Chinese dish of lamian. 
                The noodles used in ramen known as chūkamen are cut rather than hand-pulled. 
                The ramen is derived from southern Chinese noodle dishes such as the char siu tangmian of Guangdong and the rousi tangmian of Jiangnan. 
                This is reflective of Yokohama Chinatown's demographics, as most Chinese settlers in the district came from the cities of Guangzhou and Shanghai.
                One theory says that ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the Chinese neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui who served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni 
                after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule. Mitsukuni became the first Japanese person to eat ramen. 
                Most historians reject this theory as a myth created by the Japanese to embellish the origins of ramen.
                According to historians, the more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced to Japan in the late 19th or early 20th centuries by Chinese immigrants living in Yokohama Chinatown.
                By 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Guangzhou and Shanghai offered a simple dish of noodles, a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. 
                Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gyōza dumplings to workers. 
                By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a charumera (チャルメラ, from the Portuguese charamela) to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still 
                retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Shōwa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out.[citation needed]
                According to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop opened in 1910, in Asakusa, Tokyo, and was named Rairaiken [ja] (来々軒). 
                The Japanese owner employed twelve Cantonese cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown and served the ramen arranged for Japanese customers.
                Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with char siu.</p>
        <h3 id="Post-WW2">Post WW2</h3>
            <p>After Japan's defeat in World War II, the American military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. 
                In December 1945, Japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years, which caused food shortages as Japan had drastically 
                reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in China and Formosa island. 
                The US flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages.
                From 1948 to 1951, bread consumption in Japan increased from 262,121 tons to 611,784 tons, but wheat also found its way into ramen, 
                which most Japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule.
                Although the Americans maintained Japan's wartime ban on outdoor food vending,[8] flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills 
                into the black markets, where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters related to the yakuza who extorted vendors for 
                protection money. Thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation.</p>
                <p>In the same period, millions of Japanese troops returned from China and continental East Asia from their posts in the Second Sino
                Japanese War. Some of them would have been familiar with wheat noodles.[8] By 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and 
                restrictions on food vending loosened, which further boosted the number of ramen vendors: private companies even rented out yatai 
                starter kits consisting of noodles, toppings, bowls, and chopsticks.[8] Ramen yatai provided a rare opportunity for small-scale postwar 
                entrepreneurship.[8] The Americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein.
                 The combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in Japan's rice-based culture.
                 Gradually, ramen became associated with urban life.</p>

        <h3 id="Noodles">Noodles</h3>
            <p>Most noodles are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and kansui [ja], 
               derived from the Chinese jiǎnshuǐ (鹼水), a type of alkaline mineral water containing sodium carbonate and usually 
               potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid. Although ramen noodles and Udon noodles 
               are both made with wheat and are similar, they are different kinds of noodle.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, ramen noodles were made by hand, but with growing popularity many ramen restaurants prefer 
                to use noodle-making machines to meet the increased demand and improve quality. Automatic ramen-making 
                machines imitating manual production methods have been available since the mid-20th century produced by such 
                Japanese manufacturers as Yamato MFG. and others.</p>
        <h3 id="Soup">Soup</h3>
            <p>Ramen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork, combined with a variety of ingredients such as pork bones, 
                katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines) beef bones, shiitake, onions, and kombu (kelp). 
                Some modern ramen broths can also be vegetable-based. Tare is often added to broth to make the soup.</p>
